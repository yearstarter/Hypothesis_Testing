# Hypothesis_Testing
## Project description
### Project context
The Library of Montana State University has a website that students use to find books and articles.

On the homepage below the library picture, there is a search bar and three big items: “Find”, “Request” and “Interact”. All three of them contain access to important information and services that the library prides itself in offering. However, the Website Analytics show that the “Interact” button has, ironically, almost no interactions.

After the interviews with the users and some brainstorming, the website team settled on 4 different new versions to test against the original “Interact” button:

- Connect
- Learn
- Help
- Services

It was decided that for a version to be considered superior, a minimum increase in click-through rate of 30% had to be detected.

The hypotheses to be tested in the experiment are the following:
- Null Hypothesis: all versions have the same CTR.
- Alternative Hypothesis: there is a difference in the CTR for the different versions.

The desired Statistical Significance was chosen to be 90%: it is a bit lower than the usual scientific standard of 95% because the consequences of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (i.e. concluding there is an effect when there is none) are not tragic, and there are constraints in the amount of time the team of experimenters have: quickness was prioritized over certainty.

The length of the experiment was established at 21 days. The test ran between May 29, 2013, and June 18, 2013.
The data was extracted from crazyegg, a service that tracks traffic to websites and provides insights and well-structured data.
